MAJOR
Implement a UI design similar to instagram, with working share buttons. Potentially a good way to get familiar again with bootstrap or learn
Tailwind

__MINOR__
A bug where some of the images are actually youtube links. Fix is just redoing the API call when a video link is found.


Maybe eventually add an easter egg to it for fun :)
